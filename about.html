  <p>
I am a designer and creative based in Vancouver. I am pursuing my bachelor's degree at Simon Fraser University studying Interactive Arts and Technology and I have an interest in UI/UX, branding and visual design.
I strive to make unique and intuitive experiences that resonate with users and remain visually appealing. </p>
<p>
  I believe that collaboration, creative storytelling and thorough research are the key ingredients needed to create successful, user-friendly applications.
</p>
  <p>
    Being a student I am constantly learning and seeking new opportunities to exercise my skills in visual design, user-research, testing and programming and grow my experiences as a designer to go above and
     beyond. I hope to pursue a career in user interface and user experience design and utilize my skills and passions in front-end design.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my personal time, I enjoy expanding my literary knowledge by reading, baking for the people I care about and expressing my creativity through drawing or writing. Additionally,
    I find fulfillment in volunteering and actively seek out opportunities to contribute to meaningful organizations in my community.
