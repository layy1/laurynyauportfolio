                The goal of this job was to make final adjustments to the wireframes currently created for the mobile app One Iota
                 Performance Inc. App (an app designed to assist users in setting goals and habits for themselves and to track
                 their ongoing progress) to design new wireframes for additional features, modes and assets for the app before
                 it was officially released. Myself and a partner were brought on to the design team of this project to
                 make these final adjustments and additions.

            <h3>Process Analysis</h3>
            <h4 class= "analysis-title">Wireframe Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              Starting with the audit of the original wireframes, I spent time reviewing the wireframes and taking
              notes on what I liked about certain wireframes and what I thought made them user-friendly and intuitive,
              as well as what aspects of the wireframes could be changed to be more visually appealing and user-friendly.
            </p>
            <p>
               From these notes, I would sketch out wireframes applying my feedback and present them to my partner and
               the co-founder of One Iota (Ryan Stolys) for feedback. Based on our group feedback I created finalized wireframe.
             </p>

             <h4 class= "analysis-title">Creating New Features</h4>
             <p>
               We were also tasked with creating additional features that had not been created for the app: Assessments,
               Daily Surveys, Teams and Subscription modes. I received an overview of the features and what information
               Ryan would like to be shown.
             </p>
              <p>
               From our previous audit of the app, I had a good idea of the brand identity,
                making it easy to stay consistent with the original style of the app. My partner and I would go
                through an iterative process, where we would separately design wireframes for the features and present
                both to Ryan, who would give feedback on what he liked and did not like. From there we would collaborate
                on our wireframes and combine the two wireframes based on our feedback to create a finalized wireframe.
              </p>

              <p>
                As a result of our consistent process, we ended up with our finalized wireframes of every major screen in the app.

              <h4 class= "analysis-title">Push Notifications</h4>
              <p>
                Our final task was to create unique and intriguing push notifications for users to receive when they had
                different combinations of in-app tasks to complete. The main goal behind all of the messages in the
                notifications was for them to be intriguing for the user receiving them, possibly causing them to share
                the notifications with their friends and allowing  One Iota to gain more exposure, and also to motivate
                the user to open their app and complete their tasks. Being an avid writer, this process was simple and
                my partner and I were able to collaborate on this task and provide critique on the content we wrote, helping us
                 determine the message that needed to be shown to properly advocate for the brand.

            <h3>Project Conflicts and Solutions</h3>
            <p>
              The biggest challenge in this project was understanding the goal of the wireframes we were
              creating. One Iota’s app largely centred around topics of health and wellbeing which were topics I was
              unfamiliar with, making it difficult to design for One Iota’s target audience as I lacked understanding.
              To understand the goal of the app and the users, I spoke with Ryan during our meetings and always asked for
              clarification when it was needed, as well as did additional research into related apps such as Headspace
              (mediation and mental wellness app) and briefly discussed with people I knew who used other fitness and health
              apps their thoughts on similar apps.
            </p>

            <h3>Project Reflections</h3>
            <p>
              This project allowed me to experience my first professional job in UI and UX design, involving weekly
              meetings and deadlines. Working on the mobile app for One Iota Performance Inc. was a new experience not
              only for me as a person, but for my skills as a designer. Auditing the app allowed me
              to develop my skills in providing useful feedback, analyzing applications and thinking of ways to make them
              more intuitive and visually interesting for users. It was very beneficial for my partner and I to stay in
              close contact with each other throughout this process to ensure we were staying consistent with the branding
              and we were making wireframes that were consistent with each other.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reflecting on this project I would have liked to make the interface more visually dynamic and interesting
              for users as parts of the design feels flat, and I feel the use of animations would have made it more
              interesting.
