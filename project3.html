      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>
          The goal of this job was to make final adjustments to the wireframes currently created for the mobile app One Iota
           Performance Inc. App (an app designed to assist users in setting goals and habits for themselves and to track
           their ongoing progress) to design new wireframes for additional features, modes and assets for the app before
           it was officially released. Myself and a partner were brought on to the design team of this project to
           make these final adjustments and additions.
        </p>
        <h3>Process Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          Starting with the audit of the original wireframes, I spent time reviewing the wireframes and taking
          notes on what I liked about certain wireframes and what I thought made them user-friendly and intuitive,
          as well as what aspects of the wireframes could be changed to be more visually appealing and user-friendly.
           From these notes, I would sketch out wireframes applying my feedback and present them to my partner and
           the co-founder of One Iota (Ryan Stolys) for feedback. Based on our group feedback my partner and I would
           create a wireframe that applied all feedback to create a finalized wireframe.
         </p>
         <p>
           We were also tasked with creating additional features that had not been created for the app: Assessments,
           Daily Surveys, Teams and Subscription modes. I received an overview of the features and what information
           Ryan would like to be shown. From our previous audit of the app, I had a good idea of the brand identity,
            making it easy to stay consistent with the original style of the app. Myself and my partner would go
            through an iterative process, where we would separately design wireframes for the features and present
            both to Ryan, who would give feedback on what he liked and did not like. From there we would collaborate
            on our wireframes and combine the two wireframes based on our feedback to create a finalized wireframe,
            ready to be critiqued.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our final task was to create unique and intriguing push notifications for users to receive when they had
            different combinations of in-app tasks to complete. The main goal behind all of the messages in the
            notifications was for them to be intriguing for the user receiving them, possibly causing them to share
            the notifications with their friends and allowing  One Iota to gain more exposure, and also to motivate
            the user to open their app and complete their tasks. Being an avid writer, this process was simple and
            my partner and I were able to collaborate on this task and provide critique on the content we wrote.
        </p>
        <h3>Project Conflicts and Solutions</h3>
        <p>
          I felt that the biggest challenge in this project was understanding the goal of the wireframes we were
          creating. One Iota’s app largely centred around topics of health and wellbeing which were topics I was
          unfamiliar with, making it difficult to design for One Iota’s target audience as I lacked understanding.
          To understand the goal of the app and the users, I spoke with Ryan during our meetings and always asked for
          clarification when it was needed, as well as did additional research into related apps such as Headspace
          (mediation and mental wellness app) and briefly discussed with people I knew who used other fitness and health
          apps their thoughts on similar apps.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Reflections</h3>
        <p>
          This project allowed me to experience my first professional job in UI and UX design, involving weekly
          meetings and deadlines. Working on the mobile app for One Iota Performance Inc. was a new experience not
          only for me as a person, but for my skills as a designer. Auditing the app allowed me
          to develop my skills in providing useful feedback, analyzing applications and thinking of ways to make them
          more intuitive and visually interesting for users. It was very beneficial for my partner and I to stay in
          close contact with each other throughout this process to ensure we were staying consistent with the branding
          and we were making wireframes that were consistent with each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflecting on this project I would have liked to make the interface more visually dynamic and interesting
          for users as parts of the design feels flat, and I feel the use of animations would have made it more
          interesting.
