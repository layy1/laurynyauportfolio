              <p class="detail-text">
                As a solo project, I created a new feature for the popular meditation guidance app Headspace and pitched the concept in class. I ideated,
                   researched, designed and prototyped a feature that involved daily journaling on Headspace, allowing users to track their emotions,
                   daily activities relating to self care, social life, fitness, and Headspace-related activities, and gave users a space to write notes down about
                    their day.

            <h3>Process Analysis</h3>
            <h4 class= "analysis-title">Research and User Interviews</h4>
            <p>
              The first step as to analyze the current app, individually and through other users to find out the wants and needs of users and features I could
              potentially add. I found two users of Headspace and asked them questions pertaining to what they like about the app, what they don’t like,
              what they feel is missing and how they use the app regularly. I found that users felt that Headspace was missing a personalized aspect that
              catered to a user’s journey with mediation and their mental health.
            </p>
            <h4 class= "analysis-title">Proposed Solutions</h4>
            <p>
              From the feedback I received I came up with two potential ideas a tailored
              for you page for users that showed user’s Headspace content that catered to what they had previously viewed, and Headspace journaling. I decided
              to move forward with the journaling feature as I felt it met
              more user needs, allowing users to track their personal growth, and goals.
            </p>
            <h4 class= "analysis-title">Final Wireframes and Prototype</h4>
            <p>
              Using Headspace’s current UI-branding I created elements and
              wireframes that were seamless and consistent with the current interface of the Headspace app, and moved them to Protopie to add user
              interactions and create my final prototype.

            <h3>Project Conflicts and Solutions</h3>
            <p>
            This project allowed me to increase my skills in prototyping. In doing so, I had to learn how to use a new software “Protopie” to build my
            prototype, which proved to be difficult for me. To combat this setback, I gave myself a lot of time to work out any issues in my prototype and research tutorials
            on how to use Protopie.
            </p>

            <h3>Project Reflections</h3>
            <p>
              This project allowed me to experience my first professional job in UI and UX design, involving weekly
              meetings and deadlines. Working on the mobile app for One Iota Performance Inc. was a new experience not
              only for me as a person, but for my skills as a designer. Auditing the app allowed me
              to develop my skills in providing useful feedback, analyzing applications and thinking of ways to make them
              more intuitive and visually interesting for users. It was very beneficial for my partner and I to stay in
              close contact with each other throughout this process to ensure we were staying consistent with the branding
              and we were making wireframes that were consistent with each other.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reflecting on this project I would have liked to make the interface more visually dynamic and interesting
              for users as parts of the design feels flat, and I feel the use of animations would have made it more
              interesting. Additionally, I would have wanted to add more educational features to my journaling feature, potentially
               allowing users to understand the benefits of the different activities listed in the daily journal, or what to do when they track a certain
                emotion (ex. how to feel better when a user tracks that they feel sad).
