      <h2>Atria Cooperative Website Redesign</h2>

      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p> Myself in a team of four were brought on to the Atria Cooperative (a non-profit organization that works on
          helping people in poverty in Vancouver) creative team to redesign Atria’s current website and reimagine
          the organization's branding. We would
          participate weekly meetings conducted by our team lead (Firm), where we would conduct an iterative process of
          analyzing Atria’s website and our original wireframes, conducting brainstorming/inspiration generation
          exercises and designing wireframes.
        </p>
        <h3>Process Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          We spent the beginning of our process creating a new brand identity for Atria to implement into our website.
          I spent time looking over inspirational resources, such as Pinterest and Dribbble, to find colours/colour
          palettes that I felt matched with Atria's current philosophy of being warm, calming and welcoming, resulting in yellows
           and cream/neutral tones. When picking fonts I went with a mix of serif and san serif fonts, to provide a more modern look,
           while still remaining professional. It was also important to choose fonts that were easy to read.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our team used an iterative process while designing the desktop and mobile wireframes in Figma.
          Initially, I did research on similar organizations and their sites and took notes on what was successful
          and what was not on their sites, to know what to apply on Atria's site.
        </p>
        <p>
          To design the wireframes, Firm suggested we did design sprints, in which each member would design their own
          wireframe of a specific page or element and as a group we could look over each wireframe and discuss what
           elements we liked the most from each wireframe before combining the ideas we liked the most together on
           the finalized wireframe. We would design within the same Figma file so we could see each other's work and stay
           consistent with the branding of the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          When designing my wireframes I preferred to include pops of colour on an otherwise neutral background to provide emphasis
           on specific information, like statistics and important messages from Atria. This provided a monochrome/modern and clean look
           for the final site.
        </p>
        <h3>Project Conflicts and Solutions</h3>
        <p>
          Being the first time I had to design for a client that had little knowledge on design language and the best practices to design
          a product that is user-friendly and visually appealing, it was difficult to communicate ideas and ask for resources (such as past designs, images, colour palettes)
          to assist in the design process.
        </p>
        <p>
          This caused our team to make everything from scratch, which in the end was successful but it was increasingly difficult to design
          a website without having any knowledge of what the organization wanted in the end product. To combat this issue extensive research was done on other websites and peer
          critique was essential to gain useful feedback, often guiding with questions such as "What do you think of this specific element?" "How does it make you feel?" "What are you drawn to most?".
        </p>
        <h3>Project Reflections</h3>
        <p >
          Unfortunately due to funding our final redesign was not able to move into development, however working
          with Atria was a very educational experience for me. I learned how to research through other websites
          effectively to gain insight and conduct a heuristic evaluation of a website to pick out areas that need
          further development. I was also able to exercise my wireframing and prototyping skills through design
          workshops with my team.
        </p>
        <p>
          During this project I was able to learn new ideating exercises and practices to conduct with a team in
          order to prompt conversation and ideation, such as researching of competitors, inspiration exploration and
          joint design sprints.
