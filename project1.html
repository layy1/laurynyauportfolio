        <h3>Process Analysis</h3>
        <h4 class= "analysis-title">Moodboard and Styleguide</h4>
        <p>
          We created a moodboard of inspiration for our brand’s colour palette and typefaces and inspirations for the final
          website. I researched other websites and photos of other web layouts for inspiration and created our potential
          colour palettes. Pulling inspiration from secondary resources, I found pieces of media that reflected a modern,
          sophisticated theme, with pops of colour to communicate the ideals of our design company (professional and creative).
        </p>

        <p class="img-cap">Project Moodboard</p>

        <h4 class= "analysis-title">HTML and CSS Coding</h4>
        <p>
          To ensure consistency with our website’s elements we created a styleguide that held example HTML code for elements
           such as buttons, form comments and product listings to be reused as needed throughout the webpage. Taking elements from the styleguide, a template was created to form a “skeleton” of necessary
            pages such as a homepage, product listings and shopping cart/checkout.
        </p>
        <p>
          I coded a majority of the HTML and CSS code using Atom (to later be moved to GitHub for easier collaboration), by first coding smaller elements (buttons, in-text links, header texts) and putting those smaller
          elements together to create sections of the website (shopping cart, product listings and checkout boxes) to then add to page templates. I created 'real' content (descriptions and images) to be added to the templates to create the finalized webpages.
        </p>
        <h3>Project Conflicts and Solutions</h3>
        <p>
          My partner and I struggled to create a web experience that was easy for the user to navigate. I was unsure how to utilize a responsive
          interface to allow the user to know what was clickable and understand the purpose behind the site’s elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          To solve this issue I asked
          others to test run our website given a specific task (for example, I asked the participants I gathered to open the site and navigate adding
          a product to the cart and checking out) and narrate their thought process aloud. This way I could see where buttons or more interaction
          feedback needed to be added for users to understand the site, and make navigating the site easier, and requiring less moving back and forth
          between pages. As a result our UI became more user-friendly and created a more pleasant experience that was enjoyed by users.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Reflections</h3>
        <p>
          This project allowed me to exercise my skills in HTML and CSS and user testing. HTML was a new skill for me when completing
          this assignment. I utilized many online resources and the process of creating the site and making it responsive
          and adaptable involved trial and error. During this project I allowed myself
          to experiment with colour palettes, however I still feel that I could have done something more creative with the colours in the final site, as
          the final product still looked very monochromatic, and similar to how I usually like to use colour.
